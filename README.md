So pleased with how this has turned out. The only design idea I haven't been able to realise (at this stage) is getting the colour of operation results to be a combination/blend of the colours of the operands. Instead, I have settled with making them random colours, which was relatively easy to achieve.

Further buttons/functions could also be added, such as modulo.
